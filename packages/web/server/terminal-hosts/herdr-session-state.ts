 * persisted to `<sessionDir>/session.json`, and that file's mtime is the last
 * moment the session's state changed. "Detached" is the whole reason herdr
 * sessions exist (they reattach), so a row that can only say "detached" is
 * withholding the one answer the operator actually wants: what was in it, and
 * how long ago. This summary is that answer, distilled from the same persisted
