// The pairing runtime controller may also advertise while it owns a local

// service instances. Remote relay / OSN pair mode still needs this beacon
// because the controller has no LAN relay service to advertise.

 * claimed here instead: the first live process to write the claim advertises,
 * everyone else stands down, and a claim whose owner died is taken over.
 *
 * Two instances starting inside the same reconcile window can both find no
 * claim and both advertise; the loser sees the winner's claim on its next pass
 * and stands down, so the duplicate window is bounded by one reconcile. That is
 * deliberately preferred to a lock, which can leak and leave the Mac silent.
