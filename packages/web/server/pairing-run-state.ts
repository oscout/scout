 * past a symlink whose target does not exist yet — which is the same bypass
 * with one directory missing. `readlink` has no such requirement, so the walk
 * follows dangling links too, and restarts from the top after each hop because
 * a link's target may itself sit behind one (`/tmp` -> `/private/tmp` on macOS

 * Two conditions, because either alone leaves the hole open:
 *
 * - `OPENSCOUT_HOME` must be set at all, matching every other user-data writer
 *   (`writeLocalConfig`, `writeOpenScoutSettings`). Without it, a path derived
 *   from `homedir()` lands in the runner's real home.
 * - the path must not be inside the REAL `~/.openscout` unless the isolation
 *   variable explicitly points there. A test that sets `OPENSCOUT_HOME` to a
 *   temp directory and then hands us a hard-coded real-home path would satisfy
 *   the first check and still leak, so the destination is checked too.
 *
 * Both checks run on canonical paths, on both sides. Containment is a claim
 * about where the bytes land, and only the resolved path knows that.
 *
 * Outside a test runner this is a no-op: production is exactly the case that is
 * supposed to write to the real home.
