/**
 * An agent-authored signal for its human operator.
 *
 * The three kinds are separated by what the agent does next, which is the only
 * distinction the operator actually acts on:
 *
 *   notify  — FYI. The agent keeps going and expects nothing back.
 *   consult — input would help, and the agent has already decided what it will
 *             do without it (`defaultAction`). Silence is a valid answer.
 *   need    — the agent cannot proceed. Silence is NOT an answer, so this is
 *             the only kind that is blocking, and the only one that raises the
 *             operator's needs-you surface.
 *
 * `notify` and `consult` stay conversational side effects: they never create a
 * flight and never imply the agent is waiting. `need` is the exception on
 * purpose — it is the agent declaring that the next move is yours.
 *
 * This is the declared counterpart to harness-level attention inference. An
 * inferred stall says "something looks stuck"; a `need` says "here is exactly
 * what I want from you", authored by the agent, and cannot be created without
 * a question (enforced at the CLI boundary, not filtered downstream).
