/**
 * Herdr workspace digest — the presentation layer over {@link HerdrSessionTopology}.
 *
 * The raw projection is faithful but shapeless: a complex session is several
 * workspaces × tabs × panes, and handing that whole tree to an operator (or to
 * an assistant that has to answer for it) buries the one thing they came for.
 * A digest ranks, groups, bounds, and describes it.
 *
 * Four commitments, in order of how much they matter:
 *
 * 1. **Attention leads.** A `blocked` pane is the only thing in a herdr session
 *    that is actually waiting on a person. It comes first, always, before any
 *    inventory. Everything else is context for it.
 * 2. **Directory is the grouping axis, not the tab.** Operators think "which
 *    repo", herdr thinks "which tab". Grouping is by the pane's literal working
 *    directory — no repo-root inference, because a guessed grouping presented as
 *    a fact is worse than an honest fragmented one.
 * 3. **Shape is described, not dumped.** A tab's layout becomes one readable
 *    phrase ("2×2 grid", "3 columns (2 · 1 · 1)") derived from the pane rects.
 * 4. **Bounded and honest.** Panes are capped and truncation is declared;
 *    `unknown` never collapses into `done`; a persisted projection is labeled
 *    last-known rather than passed off as live.
 *
 * There are no mutation verbs here, for the same reason there are none in the
 * topology projection: herdr owns workspaces, tabs and panes, and Scout's layer
 * is coordination over whatever host is present. A digest pane carries the
 * herdr `target` string so a caller can construct a handoff; performing it is
 * the herdr client's job.
