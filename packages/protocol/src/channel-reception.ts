/**
 * Honest reception state for a channel member.

 * Channel membership is a durable fact. Whether a member can actually receive
 * a message right now is a live judgement, and the two must never be conflated
 * — a roster that renders every member as "listening" because a row exists is
 * the specific failure this module prevents.
 *
 * Two independent axes carry the truth:
 *
 * - {@link ChannelReceptionRouteKind} — what the attached transport *can* do.
 *   A `claude_resume` or `codex_exec` endpoint has no persistent listener at
 *   all: a delivery wakes a fresh run. That is a legitimate route, but calling
 *   it "listening" would be a lie.
 * - {@link ChannelReceptionState} — what the route is doing at this instant,
 *   read from endpoint state and heartbeat freshness.
