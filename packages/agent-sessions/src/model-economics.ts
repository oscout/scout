/**
 * The consummate models representation: models.dev-backed economics
 * (model-economics.generated.ts) with a curated opinion layered on top.
 *
 * The opinion has two axes:
 *
 * 1. POPULAR_MODEL_FAMILIES — the order product surfaces present families
 *    in: the popular heads first (Claude, OpenAI, OpenRouter as the gateway,
 *    MiniMax, Grok-with-a-K), then the long tail. Access paths like OpenCode
 *    and Pi are harnesses, not families — they ride these families' models —
 *    so they don't appear here; this list is about whose models they are.
 *
 * 2. FAMILY_TIER_PICKS — per family, the clear winner per cost tier. The
 *    `inexpensive` tier is the one products should default to for cheap
 *    cognition: classification, extraction, structuring, reconciliation —
 *    calls where the answer is checkable and the token bill must not be the
 *    reason the feature stays off.
 *
 * Pure (no node deps) so it rides the browser bundle. Prices are USD per 1M
 * tokens and come from the generated catalog — a pick with no catalog row is
 * a test failure, which is what keeps this list honest as models retire.
