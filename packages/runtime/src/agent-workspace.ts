// Agent workspace isolation.
//
// A dispatched agent runs in an isolated git worktree so its edits don't
// clobber the operator's working tree. This module owns the single shared
// implementation that used to be duplicated byte-for-byte inline in the desktop
// and web mobile services.
//
// The only strategy today is `git worktree add` — branch `scout/<agent>` under
// `<projectRoot>/.scout-worktrees/<agent>` — which is exactly the prior behavior
// (this is a pure de-duplication). A copy-on-write (APFS clonefile) strategy,
// workspace teardown, and merge-back were prototyped but deferred; see
// docs/eng/isolation-cow-vs-worktrees.md for the design and the review blockers
// that gate them.
