/**
 * Hot-set history rotation. `history.rotate` carries a week-clock cutoff; the
 * in-memory snapshot and the journal keep only records from the live windows
 * — SQLite holds everything. Eviction is a cache rotation, not a semantic
 * delete: no tombstones, no events, and never anything a live reader could
 * still need.
 *
 * Eviction follows a dependency closure, not record age alone:
 *
 * - PROTECTED: messages and invocations referenced by any non-terminal
 *   delivery, any non-terminal invocation dispatch job, any non-terminal
 *   flight, every read-cursor message anchor (`lastReadMessageId`) — plus
 *   the `messageId`/`replyToMessageId` of every invocation that is itself
 *   not evictable.
 * - Invocation: evictable only when `createdAt < cutoff`, it has at least
 *   one flight, every flight is terminal, and it is not protected. "No
 *   flight" is NOT terminal evidence — a flightless invocation stays.
 * - Flight: evictable only when terminal AND (`completedAt ?? startedAt`)
 *   < cutoff AND its invocation is evictable in the same rotation (or
 *   already absent). A terminal flight kept with its invocation is the
 *   evidence that lets a later rotation retire both — removing it early
 *   would leak the invocation forever.
 * - Message: evictable only when `createdAt < cutoff` and not protected.
 * - Delivery: evictable only when terminal AND (its referent was evicted by
 *   a rotation OR every referent is already absent from the snapshot —
 *   nothing left to protect). Unlinked intents carry no age evidence and
 *   are kept.
 * - Registry, conversation, and binding records are never touched — that
 *   is the retention sweep's job.
 *
 * OPENSCOUT_BROKER_DISK_HISTORY limitation: under the disk-backed async
 * message history, `snapshot.messages` is a proxy that cannot enumerate or
 * answer synchronous membership. Message eviction is not implemented there —
 * messages are retained and journal compaction keeps their lines (the doom
 * sets stay empty for messages), until disk-history rotation lands.
