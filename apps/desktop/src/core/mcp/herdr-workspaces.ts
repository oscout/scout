/**
 * `herdr_workspaces` — the read side of Scout's herdr coordination layer.
 *
 * Herdr owns workspaces, tabs and panes; Scout coordinates over whatever host
 * is present and never becomes a second layout manager. So this tool reads a
 * ranked digest and stops there. It has no mutation verb, and it deliberately
 * does not shell `herdr` itself: the web server already owns that probe and its
 * cache, and a caller that cannot reach the server should learn that rather
 * than quietly open a second path to the same binary.
 *
 * The tool returns the rendered digest as its text content — attention first,
 * then motion, then directories, then arrangement — because that ordering is
 * the presentation, not a formatting detail. Structured content carries the
 * same digest for callers that want the fields.
